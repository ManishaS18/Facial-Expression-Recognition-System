# Facial-Expression-Recognition-System

This repository hosts the Facial Emotion Recognition System, an advanced project aimed at automatically detecting and recognizing human emotions from facial expressions. Built on cutting-edge machine learning techniques, this system leverages the power of computer vision and deep learning algorithms to analyze facial images or video streams and accurately identify the underlying emotions.

### Problem Statement:
This project is based on Image Classification Problem, and this forms the basis of many computer vision problems.
This project would prove helpful for medical imaging, machine vision, object detection, etc 

### Key Features:
  1. **Emotion Detection**: The core functionality of this system is to detect emotions from facial expressions. It can recognize a wide range of emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and disgust, among others.
  2. **Deep Learning Models**: The repository includes state-of-the-art deep learning models trained on large emotion-labeled datasets. These models employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and ResNet50 models to extract meaningful features from facial data and make accurate emotion predictions.
  3. **Preprocessing Utilities**: To ensure optimal performance, a set of preprocessing utilities is provided to handle tasks such as face detection, alignment, and normalization. These utilities help prepare input data by removing noise, enhancing facial features, and ensuring consistent input format.
  4.** Evaluation Metrics**: The repository includes evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the emotion recognition system. These metrics measure accuracy and loss, allowing researchers and developers to evaluate and compare different models or configuration
  5. **Datasets**: Several publicly available emotion datasets are included in the repository. These datasets can be used for training, testing, and fine-tuning emotion recognition models. Additionally, guidelines and scripts for data augmentation are provided to increase the diversity and robustness of the models.
