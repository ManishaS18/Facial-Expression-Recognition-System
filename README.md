# Facial-Expression-Recognition-System

This repository hosts the Facial Emotion Recognition System, an advanced project aimed at automatically detecting and recognizing human emotions from facial expressions. Built on cutting-edge machine learning techniques, this system leverages the power of computer vision and deep learning algorithms to analyze facial images or video streams and accurately identify the underlying emotions.

### Problem Statement:
This project is based on Image Classification Problem, and this forms the basis of many computer vision problems.
This project would prove helpful for medical imaging, machine vision, object detection, etc
